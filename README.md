   ## Description of the GUI Interface
   This screenshot depicts our current visual of what the user would see when the start the program. The user will be shown various options on the left side of the screen, starting with the first option to connect their headset. The option labeled “Cursor Control” will start the software to translate the brain waves generated by the users headset to allow the user to move the mouse cursor. The option “Save Data” will allow the user to save their data graphs through a “.txt” file. Further down we have the “Tutorial” option in which will allow the user to revisit the demo on how to meditate with cursor control as well as potentially provide them with short trails on movement. The final option to the left is the “Settings” option, this will provide basic settings the user can adjust to the software's default settings and options. Finally, we see the software will provide the live brainwave data to be depicted alongside these options. Also depicted are the shortcuts below for the user to access  at a quicker response time for simplicity. The buttons are also large for easy access to the options.
